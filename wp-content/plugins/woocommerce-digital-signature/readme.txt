= Electronic Signature Security and Encryption =
Security is our priority. All of your signed documents and signatures are kept hidden and encrypted on your server using a secure encryption sequence and signer specific URL.

Documents move turbo speed from signer to signer. We include a detailed audit report with viewer details, ip addresses, analytics and signer history.

= Document Signing Automation =
If you do business online, customers probably have to sign an agreement or an online contract. Problem is a paper agreement doesn’t hold up if your business is an online business and your customers are online customers. You can try mailing or even scanning a contract to your digital customers which costs you time and money, in the meantime you have the risk of losing your customer because of the added delay.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Can I collect legally binding court recognized contracts from my WooCommerce plugin before someone checks out? =

With ApproveMe’s WooCommerce Digital Signature plugin, along with a [WP E-Signature](https://www.approveme.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=woocommerce) business license you can easily collect [UETA/ESIGN compliant](https://www.approveme.com/ueta-and-esign-act/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=woocommerce) signatures from your customers before they complete their WooCommerce checkout.

= What’s the Difference between the WP Digital Signature Plugin vs. a Form Generation Plugin =


international document signing guidelines. Do the smart thing and don’t get caught in a courtroom with a document that isn’t legally binding.

= Are Digital Signature Legal? =

Yes, electronic digital signatures are legally binding in the United States and many countries around the world.  **United States** in the US there are two digital signature Acts that established the legality of digital signatures in the US – the [Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Signatures_in_Global_and_National_Commerce_Act) (ESIGN, 2000) and the [Uniform Electronic Transactions Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Electronic_Transactions_Act) (UETA, 1999). Both the ESIGN and UETA establish that electronic records and signatures carry the same weight and legal effect as traditional paper documents and handwritten signatures, they say “A document or signature cannot be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.” The ApproveMe WP E-Signature plugin is UETA/ESIGN compliant.

**United Kingdom**
In the UK, similar legislation to the ESIGN Act in the USA was likewise settled in 2000, and is known as the UK Electronic Communication Act. Approve Me is the main WordPress Plugin to Sign Contracts that warrants its eSignature solution to be consistent with this act.

**European Union**
The appropriation of the European Directive 1999/93/EC of 13 December 1999 established a the utilization of electronic marks on electronic and digital contracts inside of the European Union (EU). Thirty European nations (EU-27, Croatia, Turkey and Liechtenstein) have officially adopted Directive 1999/93/EC. To that end Electronic and Digital marks are effectively being used in Europe, and ApproveMe’s compliant WordPress E-Signature plugin is legitimately acceptable and enforceable within the European Union.

= Will I Need to Renew my ApproveMe License? =

Yes you will. Each license key is valid for one calendar year from the purchase date. An active license key is needed for access to automatic/critical updates, plugin support and access to our growing [eSignature add-on library](https://www.approveme.com/esign-features/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=woocommerce).

= Where Can I Find My License Key? =

If you’ve already purchased a license key and need to retrieve the license number, you can do that on the [support site here](https://www.approveme.com/profile/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=woocommerce) or follow [these detailed steps](https://www.approveme.com/wp-digital-signature-plugin-docs/article/install-and-activate-plugins-extensions/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=woocommerce). Once you’ve successfully logged into the support site (using the credentials emailed to you at the time of purchase), your active license key(s) will be listed at the bottom of the page.

= What do I get with my *approve me* business license =

Your business license grants you access to all of our support resources, documentation, product downloads and basic and advanced add-ons like Stand Alone Documents, Document Templates, Unlimited Sender Roles and others, (which are required for this WooCommerce Wordpress esignature Plugin) for one calendar year from your purchase date.

= How much does it cost to renew my license? =

The Ultimate Plan does not have a renewal cost.  It is a one-time payment for the WP Esignature plugin.  However all other plans have an annual renewal.  Our goal has always been to pull the price back as much as we possibly can so small businesses and freelancers could sign documents electronically using their WordPress website (and save alot of money in the process). Not only is our plugin the most powerful of its kind, it’s also the most affordable.  Not to throw anyone under the bus, but look at what our competitors charge every single year:

Adobe charges $1,080 / yr (per 3 users)
Docusign charges $1,440 / yr (per 3 users)

Not charing for renewals would actually hurt the product as we would not be able to invest as heavily as we currently do back into it...

= What do I get for renewing my license? =

Renewing your license provides an additional year of support and software updates. This provides peace of mind knowing you can turn to us for WP Electronic Signature related support and assistance. You’ll also continue receiving software updates to ensure WordPress compatibility (and security) as well as great new features and enhancements! Also (depending on your license) as we release new basic and premium add-ons you will be able download these at anytime.
