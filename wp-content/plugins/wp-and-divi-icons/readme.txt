=== WP and Divi Icons: The Best Icon Plugin for WordPress and Divi ===

If you're looking for icons to add to your WordPress or Divi website, look no further than the WP and Divi Icons plugin by [Aspen Grove Studios](https://aspengrovestudios.com/?utm_source=ds-icon-expansion&utm_medium=plugin-readme-link&utm_content=plugin-description-by). 

Helping WordPress and Divi users build attractive and engaging page and post layouts and content, the WP and Divi Icons plugin adds over 300 custom icons to the WordPress visual editor and the Divi framework. WP and Divi Icons is available as a plugin for WordPress and Divi websites, and can also be used as a standalone icon set for both commercial and personal creative projects by [downloading the icon files from our website](https://aspengrovestudios.com/product/divi-icon-expansion-pack/?utm_source=ds-icon-expansion&utm_medium=plugin-readme-link&utm_content=download-icons).

==== Add Icons Using the WordPress Editor ====

Compatible with any standards-compliant WordPress theme, the WP and Divi Icons plugin lets users add icons directly into a page or post with the standard WYSIWYG WordPress editor (TinyMCE). After selecting a custom icon from the WP and Divi Icons library, the icon can be styled directly within the "Insert icon" dialog. Color, size and title variables are defined directly from within the editor window itself, with a live preview of how the icon will appear once it is inserted into the content being edited. Users can also assign a CSS class to the icon to create deeper levels of customization using a stylesheet.

==== Add Icons Using the Divi Builder ====

Built with special functionality to integrate with the Divi theme framework, the WP and Divi Icons plugin can be used in conjunction with any compatible Divi Builder module that allows for the inclusion of icons, such as the Blurb module and the Button module. The WP and Divi Icons plugin will automatically add a series of icons to the Divi Builder’s icon picker, which will display following the default Elegant Themes icons that come standard with the Divi theme. 

==== Use Custom Icons in Personal and Commercial Projects ====

In addition to using the plugin for the WordPress and Divi frameworks, the icons included in the WP and Divi Icons plugin can be used as standalone graphics for both commercial and personal use. Licensed under Creative Commons, the 300+ custom icons can be edited with leading image editing software to match brand identity and business aesthetic.
