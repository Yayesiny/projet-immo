Divi Mega Menu by QuadMenu is the best plugin to easily integrate a Mega Menu into your themes.

This plugin has been designed for both regular users and developers. The menu has a simple and intuitive interface, integrated into the Divi customizer dashboard, allowing you to create and customize an unlimited amount of mega menus and tabs menus without any programming skills.

For developers who want to fully customize the plugin, QuadMenu offers additional tools to integrate the menu into your theme, like advanced configuration options and hooks or custom CSS field.

Divi Mega Menu by QuadMenu has been integrated in a way that you will hardly notice that you are coming out of the native WordPress operation.

From the native menu administration panel, you can manage all the content of your megamenu, add new elements, create columns and add widgets or any other type of element available in metaboxes.
